<!-- You've probably heard someone talk about "self-documenting" code. The idea is -->

that by writing code with variables and functions that document themselves,
engineers don't have to spend as much time explicitly documenting code.

I want to discuss why that is rarely the case.

People who write "self-documenting" code aren't monsters. They are just
listening to the community, hearing this idea, and rolling with it. Let's look
at a quick example of so-called "self-documenting" code, then deconstruct the
ways in which it's not self-documenting. Once we've examined that, we'll talk
about some other options.

Imagine a simple function like this - called to render some React elements given
some items.

```jsx
const createList = (...listElems) => {
  return listElems.map(listItem => {
    return (
      <li className="ListItem">
        {listItem.text}
        <span className="ListItem--count">{listItem.count}</span>
      </li>
    );
  });
};
```

Let's step through this line-by-line and see how long it takes us to reason
about this code.

```jsx
const createList = (...listElems) => {
```

We've started with this line. Right off the bat, we know this function takes
`listElems`, which comes in as an array... Or do we? This code is presupposing a
lot about the reader of this function. Do they know that the `...` syntax in JS
means an array?

Let's assume the understand the basics of JS as we continue on.

```jsx
  return listElems.map(listItem => {
```

We are now returning the mapped over `listElems`. Hopefully our reader knows how
the `map` function works. We still don't know what a `listItem` looks like.
Let's keep going.

```jsx
    return (
      <li className="ListItem">
        {listItem.text}
        <span className="ListItem--count">
          {listItem.count}
        </span>
      </li>
```

The last lines are all JSX and start to tell us the real content of this
function. We can see that we are returning an li - this function should get
called from inside an ul component. We can also see that we are accessing text
and count on the listItem, which means we need to pass in an object with that
structure.

A lot of presupposition is happening here - we figure the reader will know what
we know and that could lead to some problems. What if someone calls this
function from outside of a ul? Or passes in the wrong arguments?

What options do we have to prevent this?

## Comment your code

## Isolate your components/functions

## Write technical documentation
