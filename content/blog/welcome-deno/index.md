# Getting started with Deno - a new runtime for Javascript and Typescript from the founder of Node

In case you missed it, the new Javascript and Typescript runtime from Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node, [has been released](https://deno.land/)! It's got some really cool features and is ready for public use! Let's look at a few of the neat features and get started with a simple hello world!

## What is Deno?

Deno is a new runtime for Typescript (and Javascript) written mostly in Rust. It has some [great goals](https://deno.land/manual.html#goals) and some very interesting "Non-Goals", like not using `npm` and not having a package.json.

## Getting it installed

Installing deno is as easy as running this command:

`curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh`

Then copy the `export` line and add it to your `~/bashrc` or `~/bash_profile`.

Open a new terminal and run `deno`. You should get a `>` prompt. Type `exit` and let's dig into some features!

## Cool features in Deno

### Typescript by default

Deno is integrated to run Typescript files by default. It basically makes types in Javascript a first-class citizen. No more compiling through Babel to use Typescript in server-side Javascript.

### Importing from a URL

Deno lets you import from the web, just like you can in the browser. Just add a URL where you would usually name a module:

```ts
import { bgBlue, red, bold } from "https://deno.land/std/colors/mod.ts";
```

### A Standard Library

Furthermore, Deno has a standard library that is easy to import and use. There are modules that do a couple of different things, like HTTP handling, datetime work, and file system work. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std).

### Uses ES modules

Finally, Deno only supports ES module syntax, which means no more `require()` statements, just good ole' `import x from "y"`.

## Hello World Example

Let's look at a quick Hello World that highlights a few of those features!

Copy this into a `hello-world.ts` file.

```js
import { bgBlue, red, bold } from "https://deno.land/std/colors/mod.ts";

const sayHello = (name: string = "world") => {
  console.log(bgBlue(red(bold(`Hello ${name}!`))));
};

sayHello();

sayHello("Conlin");
```

You can now run that with `deno hello-world.ts` and it should print out some stuff.

Change one of the `sayHello` calls to `sayHello(15);` and rerun it. You should see a type error since 15 isn't a string! That's pretty cool!

You'll also notice how to import from a URL - it's getting some console color stuff from the standard library!

# Final thoughts

Deno isn't quite ready for the production use - there are a couple [bugs](https://deno.land/benchmarks.html#req-per-sec), but development is moving forward quickly! This is definitely a cool new open source project and one to keep an eye on!
