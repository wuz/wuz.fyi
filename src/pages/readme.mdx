# Wuz, For Your Information

<Aside>

## What the heck is this?

The engineer readme is inspired by [Manager Readme](https://managerreadme.com/).

## About Me

Hi! I'm Conlin. I'm an frontend engineer, with a big interest in the
intersection of art, community, and technology.

## Motivation for the Document

This is my Engineer Readme, a document that should help introduce you to how I
like to work, my main motivations as an engineer, and some possible next
chapters in my career narrative. This document is purposefully incomplete, as we
humans are always growing and evolving. Want to know more?
[Reach out](https://twitter.com/CallMeWuz)!

Please treat this as a reference to my goals, aspirations, and needs as an
engineer. If your company values don't align, please don't reach out for
recruitment opportunities.

## Looking for Work?

I am not currently looking for work.

## How I Like To Work

My ideal working environment is pretty flexible. That being said, there are a
few things I view as a requirement for my workplace:

1. Diversity and inclusion policies and an open mind towards new initiatives
2. Understanding and openness around mental health
3. People > Process
4. A solid remote work policy
5. A good growth framework/process for engineers

In addition, my ideal workplace would also have:

1. A good policy towards open source
2. A good conference budget/ability for engineers to go
3. Lots of interaction with the people using what I build
4. A healty policy around communication that allows people to work deeply

### My Average Week

My main task in every week is staying on top of any frontend development that
needs to be done. Secondarily I have a couple commitments I have the pleasure to
work on, like diversity and inclusion, thinking through some product strategy
with my squad, and working towards my goal of becoming an engineering manager.

What this means is that I spend a good amount of my time in periods of Deep Work
(or at least trying to) split up as minimally as possible by meetings around
design, feature planning, 1-1 with my manager, and pairing sessions. For more
about this, I'd highly recommend reading the
[Maker/Manager Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).

In an attempt to focus deeply, I sometimes don't immediately respond to Slack.
During Deep Work time, I turn on Do Not Disturb on Slack and close my email
apps. If you need to get a hold of me urgently, I'd recommend forcing Slack to
send a message through the Do Not Disturb settings, but **please only do this if
it is really urgent**. After a deep working session, I check all my
notifications - Slack, email, Github, ticket tracking, etc.

## My motivations as an engineer

### Be friendly, be kind

I find kindness to be an incredibly important skill for anyone to learn and
master. It's important to know the difference between kind and nice. A good
example can be found when dealing with feedback. Kind feedback is truthful
without being hurtful. It's delivered at the right time and done out of care for
the individual. Nice feedback avoids hard truths in favor of platitudes. It
doesn't help people grow, it just tells them what they want to hear.

### Living a better life

I also believe the goal of all technology should be to enable people to live
better lives. The plow speeds up the harvest so that the farmer might spend more
time learning or engaging in family life. A good peice of software enables
people to more effectively do their jobs so that they can live their lives more
fully.

### Be a prism, not a mirror

Creatives are better served acting as prisms, rather than mirrors. They
shouldn't mearly reflect values or opinions, but instead should take them,
refine them and focus them on the task they are trying to accomplish.

My job as a developer is to take in a set of inputs - business requirements,
market factors, and more - and concentrate them into a tool that helps people do
their work better.

### Live by principles

I keep a running list of principles and mental models that I follow. I do my
best to live and work by those principles. You can find a running (albiet
unstructured) list of those prinicipals in this
[Notion Doc](https://www.notion.so/wuz/principles-e4502297f3114f7b9e2dbdcc468f45f8)

## Career development

There are a few areas where I am looking to move/grow in my career:

1. Engineering Managment
2. Product Strategy
3. Developer Advocacy
